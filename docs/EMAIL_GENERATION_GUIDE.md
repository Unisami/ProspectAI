# Email Generation Guide

## Introduction

The Job Prospect Automation system uses AI-powered email generation to create highly personalized outreach emails. This guide focuses on how the system uses sender context (your professional background and experience) to enhance email personalization and improve response rates.

## Sender Context in Email Generation

### How Sender Context Improves Personalization

Traditional email personalization focuses only on the recipient's information. Our system takes personalization to the next level by incorporating both recipient and sender context:

1. **Dual-sided Personalization**: Emails are personalized based on both the recipient's profile and your professional background
2. **Relevant Experience Matching**: The system automatically identifies and highlights your most relevant experience for each prospect
3. **Industry-specific Tailoring**: Your experience in specific industries is emphasized when contacting prospects in those industries
4. **Skill Alignment**: Your skills are matched with the prospect's company needs and highlighted accordingly
5. **Value Proposition Customization**: Your unique value proposition is tailored to each prospect's specific situation

### Key Benefits

- **Higher Response Rates**: Emails that demonstrate relevant experience and skills receive significantly higher response rates
- **More Meaningful Connections**: Highlighting genuine alignment between your background and the prospect's needs creates stronger connections
- **Time Savings**: The system automatically identifies and emphasizes your most relevant experience for each prospect
- **Consistent Messaging**: Your core value proposition remains consistent while being tailored to each recipient

## How Sender-Aware Email Generation Works

The system uses the unified `AIService` to integrate your sender profile into the email generation process:

1. **Profile Loading**: Your sender profile is loaded from your chosen format (markdown, JSON, or YAML)
2. **Prospect Analysis**: The system analyzes the prospect's company, role, and background
3. **Relevance Matching**: Your experience and skills are matched against the prospect's profile
4. **AI Processing**: The unified `AIService` generates an email using multiple AI operations:
   - LinkedIn profile parsing for prospect context
   - Product analysis for company insights
   - Email generation with personalization scoring
5. **Content Generation**: The AI generates an email that highlights your most relevant experience
6. **Personalization**: The email includes specific details about both you and the prospect
7. **Caching**: Results are cached for performance optimization

## Examples of Sender-Aware Email Generation

### Example 1: Technical Role Match (New Emotionally Resonant Approach)

**Prospect**: CTO at a fintech startup

**Sender Profile Highlights**:
- 5 years experience as a Software Engineer
- Strong background in payment systems
- Experience with AWS infrastructure

**Generated Email Excerpt**:
```
Subject: Obsessed with FinPay's API-first approach

**tl;dr**: Built payment systems for 5 years, reduced API latency by 40% at my last startup, genuinely excited about what you're building.

Hi Jane,

Found FinPay on ProductHunt yesterday and honestly got a bit obsessed reading through your docs. The way you've architected the fraud detection layer is exactly what I wish we'd had at my last fintech gig.

I've spent 5 years building payment infrastructure—most recently led the team that cut our API response times by 40% (from 200ms to 120ms average). The scale challenges you're probably hitting post-Series A are ones I've lived through.

Your focus on developer experience reminds me why I got into this space. Would love to chat about how my Python/AWS background could help as you scale the platform.

Best,
[Name]

### Example 2: Design Role Match (New Emotionally Resonant Approach)

**Prospect**: Head of Product at a SaaS company

**Sender Profile Highlights**:
- UX/UI Designer with 4 years experience
- Portfolio of B2B SaaS products
- Expertise in user research and testing

**Generated Email Excerpt**:
```
Subject: TaskFlow's UX actually makes sense (rare!)

**tl;dr**: B2B SaaS designer for 4 years, boosted engagement 35% at ClientBase, your workflow automation approach is refreshingly intuitive.

Hi Alex,

Stumbled on TaskFlow through ProductHunt and had to reach out—finally, a workflow tool that doesn't make me want to throw my laptop out the window.

I've been designing B2B SaaS interfaces for 4 years, and the number of "automation platforms" that are basically digital torture devices is depressing. Your approach to progressive disclosure in the workflow builder is exactly what I implemented at ClientBase (35% engagement boost).

The enterprise clients I've worked with always struggle with the same thing: powerful features buried under terrible UX. You've clearly cracked that code.

Would love to chat about how my research background could help as you expand into more complex enterprise workflows.

Cheers,

## Troubleshooting Sender Profile Issues

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Email doesn't include my relevant experience
**Solution**: Ensure your sender profile includes detailed experience descriptions and achievements. The more specific you are about your experience, the better the system can match it to prospects.

#### Issue: Skills aren't being highlighted correctly
**Solution**: Make sure your key skills are listed in your sender profile and are specific rather than generic. "React development" is better than just "development".

#### Issue: Value proposition isn't clear in emails
**Solution**: Refine your value proposition in your sender profile to be more specific about the benefits you bring. Focus on outcomes rather than activities.

#### Issue: Location/availability information missing
**Solution**: Add your location, remote work preference, and availability to your sender profile to ensure this information is included in emails.

#### Issue: Emails sound generic despite sender profile
**Solution**: Increase your profile completeness score by adding more details to all sections, especially notable achievements and industry-specific experience.

### Profile Completeness Impact

The completeness of your sender profile directly impacts email personalization quality:

- **90-100%**: Excellent - Highly personalized emails with specific relevant experience
- **70-89%**: Good - Solid personalization with general relevant background
- **50-69%**: Fair - Basic personalization with limited sender context
- **Below 50%**: Poor - Minimal sender context, mostly generic emails

## Using Sender Profiles with Email Generation

### Command Line Interface

To generate emails using your sender profile with the unified AI service:

```
python cli.py email generate --prospect-id 123 --sender-profile profiles/my_profile.md
```

Options:
- `--prospect-id`: ID of the prospect in Notion
- `--sender-profile`: Path to your sender profile file
- `--template`: Email template type (cold_outreach, referral_followup, product_interest, networking)
- `--interactive`: Enable interactive review and editing of generated emails
- `--use-cache`: Enable AI result caching for faster processing (default: true)

### Batch Email Generation

To generate emails for multiple prospects:

```
python cli.py email generate-batch --prospect-ids 123,456,789 --sender-profile profiles/my_profile.md
```

Options:
- `--prospect-ids`: Comma-separated list of prospect IDs
- `--sender-profile`: Path to your sender profile file
- `--delay`: Delay between emails in seconds (default: 2.0)
- `--max-emails`: Maximum number of emails to generate (default: 10)

### Configuration Options

You can set default sender profile options in your config.yaml file:

```yaml
sender_profile:
  enable: true
  path: profiles/default_profile.md
  format: markdown
  interactive_setup: true
  require_profile: false
  completeness_threshold: 0.7
```
