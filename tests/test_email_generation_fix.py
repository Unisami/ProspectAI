print("\n📝 EXPLANATION:")
print("The CLI was filtering out prospects WITHOUT emails before email generation.")
print("This is backwards - email generation should work for ALL prospects!")
print("Email addresses are found separately via Hunter.io.")

print("\n🎯 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR NOW:")
print("✅ --generate-emails flag should generate emails for all found prospects")
print("✅ Email generation should work even without existing email addresses")
print("✅ Personalization should use LinkedIn profiles, company info, etc.")

print("\n🚀 READY TO TEST:")
print("Run: python cli.py run-campaign --limit 1 --generate-emails")
print("Should now see: 'Generating emails for X prospects...' instead of 'No prospects with emails found'")
