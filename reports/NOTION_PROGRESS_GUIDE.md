# Notion Progress Dashboard Guide

## Overview

The Job Prospect Automation system now includes a comprehensive progress tracking dashboard built directly into Notion. This allows you to monitor campaigns, view real-time progress, and track system performance without needing a separate web interface.

## Setup

### 1. Create the Dashboard

Run the setup script to create your Notion progress dashboard:

```bash
python setup_dashboard.py
```

This will create:
- üìä **Main Dashboard Page** - Overview and navigation
- üéØ **Campaign Runs Database** - Track active and completed campaigns
- üìã **Processing Log Database** - Detailed step-by-step processing logs
- ‚öôÔ∏è **System Status Database** - Monitor component health and API usage

### 2. Configure Database IDs

After setup, add the database IDs to your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
# Progress Tracking
ENABLE_PROGRESS_TRACKING: 'true'
DASHBOARD_ID: 'your-dashboard-id-here'
CAMPAIGNS_DB_ID: 'your-campaigns-db-id-here'
LOGS_DB_ID: 'your-logs-db-id-here'
STATUS_DB_ID: 'your-status-db-id-here'
```

## Usage

### Running Campaigns with Progress Tracking

```bash
# Run complete campaign with automatic progress tracking
python cli.py run-campaign --limit 10 --generate-emails --campaign-name "Morning Discovery"

# Alternative: Discovery only
python cli.py discover --limit 10 --campaign-name "Morning Discovery"

# Check campaign status
python cli.py campaign-status
