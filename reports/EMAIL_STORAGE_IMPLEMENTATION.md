python cli.py generate-emails-recent --limit 5

# Test email generation and storage
python test_email_storage.py
```

### View Email Statistics
```bash
# View comprehensive email analytics
python email_stats.py

# Get statistics programmatically
python -c "
from services.notion_manager import NotionDataManager
from utils.config import Config

config = Config.from_file('config.yaml')
notion = NotionDataManager(config)
stats = notion.get_email_generation_stats()
print(f'Emails generated: {stats[\"emails_generated\"]}')
print(f'Success rate: {stats[\"generation_success_rate\"]:.1%}')
"
```

### Filter Prospects by Status
```bash
# Get prospects with generated emails
python -c "
from services.notion_manager import NotionDataManager
from utils.config import Config

config = Config.from_file('config.yaml')
notion = NotionDataManager(config)
prospects = notion.get_prospects_by_email_status(generation_status='Generated')
print(f'Found {len(prospects)} prospects with generated emails')
"
```
